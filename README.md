Create standalone desktop apps that use Firefox as a runtime.

*wxperimental, work in progress, do not use*

Web browsers provide a stable and rich application environment. This
has made Electron a popular tool for building desktop applications.
Firetron is similar to Electron, but does is based on Firefox, making
it a more lightweight alternative.

Further, apps created with Firetron can make use of the Firefox that a user has
installed on the system. Therefore, frozen apps can be as small as 10 MB.
